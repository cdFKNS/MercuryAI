# Reflection: MercuryAI Project

## Approach
Our team followed an agile, collaborative approach to build MercuryAI. We started by breaking down the requirements into clear tasks and assigning roles based on strengths: frontend, backend, and scrum master. We used a Kanban board to track progress and ensure transparency. The project was developed in phases: repo setup, feature implementation, integration, and deployment. We prioritized security by using a backend proxy for API calls and keeping secrets out of the public repo.

## What We Learned
- **Teamwork & Communication:** Regular check-ins and clear task assignments helped us stay aligned and resolve blockers quickly.
- **Agile Planning:** Using a Kanban board and iterative development made it easier to adapt to changes and deliver features incrementally.
- **Frontend/Backend Integration:** We learned how to securely connect a static frontend to a backend API, and how to use localStorage for persistence.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts for AI content generation was key to getting high-quality outputs.
- **Security Best Practices:** We reinforced the importance of never exposing API keys and using environment variables.
- **Deployment:** Deploying both frontend and backend, and updating API endpoints for production, was a valuable experience.

## Final Thoughts
MercuryAI taught us the value of planning, communication, and security in real-world software projects. We are proud of our teamwork and the final product.
